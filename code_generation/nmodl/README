To convert a 9ML xml file to NMODL, run
$ python 9ml2nmodl.py filename.xml
This will produce filename.mod
This may then be compiled using nrnivmodl, and then tested using one of the test scripts, e.g.
$ python test_Izhikevich.py
which will pop-up a graph (if you have pylab installed) showing the membrane potential trace.

WARNING: this script is not yet working properly. The Izhikevich model seems to work fine, but for the LeakyIAF the refractory regime is not observed.

Dependencies:
  lxml - http://codespeak.net/lxml/
  MathDOM - http://mathdom.sourceforge.net/
  NEURON - http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/
  Python >= 2.5
