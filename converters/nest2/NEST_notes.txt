# Bindings are just recalculated on resetting user parameters
# so loop over them after user setting of parameters
# Expose them in param getting for testing if $model.debug=True.

Need an integer state var for neuron and each synapse which tells what regime we are in.

enums at the top:

typedef enum {
REGIME_NMDA_PSR_inter_event_regime,
REGIME_NMDA_PSR_on_event_regime
}

i.e.

int regime_
int syn_$synmodel_regime






Then a big switch/case statement one the regime for each synapse and neuron
execute Regime code, then evaluate transition which assigns new regime enum

Handle condition=None for nmda -> Always switch after first code execution.
i.e. condition=None maps to condition="true"
#transition2 = Transition(on_event_regime, inter_event_regime, condition=None)




class NestModel:

      nest_classname
      header_name // name of .h file
      long_description
      short_description
      parameters
      state_vars
      binds
      
      debug // get variables/bindings @ GetStatus
      
      regimes
      initial_regime
      

class Regime
      steps //assignments+ODEs in sequence, 
            // unions place members in arbitrary order on the sequence, 
            // but preserving internal order if a member is union or sequence.

      
      transitions


class Transition

      condition
      assignments
      to_regime

NB: conditions, assignments needs to have symbol remappings, see below.
      

class Assignment
      lhs
      expression

class ODE
      var
      rhs
      
Throw exception for 2nd var != "t"
Map i.e. V to S_.V


NB: lhs and expression needs to have symbol remappings, see below.

class StateVar
      unit
      Ctype
      symbol

class Bind
      Ctype
      symbol
      expression

NB: expression needs to have symbol remappings, see below. 
      


class Parameter
      notes
      unit
      Ctype
      symbol
      

NB: w.r.t. all expressions, assignments, conditions, 

* All expressions will need to be search replaced with:
symbol -> P_.symbol for parameters
       -> V_.symbol for binds
       -> S_.symbol for statevars


* All Assignments in a regime need state vars for lhs.

* TODO: debugging information for expressions, check validity with pycparser or Cython?
