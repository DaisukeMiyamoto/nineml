1) Test suite should check that implementation throws exception when building component
that tries to assign to parameters or read-only ports

2) For events that trigger transitions, the test suite must check that
the implementation can handle multiple events per time step.

3) The test suite must check that the implementation handles
generate_event where the event is the condition for another
transition.  In this case, the state for the event triggered
transition is defined as the regime after the top Transition (with
"generate_event").  I.e. the two transitions will effectively be
chained.  Transitions which are triggered by events which are not with
from_=="to" of the Transition which did the generate_event should not
be not be triggered.
