Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~

Unit tests can be run with 'nosetests'

The unit tests are in a hierachy similar to the package, in unit/nineml_test

To run tests on the 'component' module for example, use the command:

nosetests unit/nineml_test/abstraction_layer/component/


Functional Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Functional tests look at the output of simulations; in particular NEURON simulations. 
Since Python-Neuron struggles with repeat calls to NEURON it is difficult to run functional
tests using nose. Therefore the tests need to run manually from the commandline. 
This needs to be improved....
