A successful 2-day 9ML committee meeting was held at the CNRS at Gif-sur-Yvette, France, with significant progress made towards the development of 9ML version 2.0. 
Of 20 proposals flagged for version 2.0 (see [http://github.com/INCF/NineMLSpec/issues](http://github.com/INCF/NineMLSpec/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A"Version+2.0")), 18 were accepted by the committee (plus an additional proposal that arose at the meeting) and a strong start was made on the remaining two.
